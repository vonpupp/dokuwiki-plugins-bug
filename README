Hello,

I'm building a dokuwiki based on Rincewind. I'm using the following plugin versions:

| Dokuwiki ^ Date ^ GIT Version ^ Compatibility ^ Download ^
^ DOKUWIKI | 2011-05-25a | | Rincewind | [[http://www.dokuwiki.org|here]] |
^ blogtng | 2009-12-16 | ab8e844 | Rincewind | [[http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:blogtng|here]] |
^ pagelist | 2010-01-07 | gc3ac680 | Rincewind | [[http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:pagelist|here]] | 
^ tag | 2011-03-20 | g36b4eb5 | Rincewind | [[http://dokuwiki.org/plugin:tag|here]] |

I have 3 pages with this content:
Page: Test1
====== openSUSE T1 ======
{{tag>opensuse}}

Page: Test2
====== openSUSE T2 ======
{{tag>opensuse}}

Page: Test3
====== openSUSE T3 ======
{{tag>opensuse}}

Then I have a 4th page to list the opensuse tags as follows:
Page: Listing
===== topic =====
{{topic>opensuse &table}}

The expected result should be a list with the posts with "opensuse" tags, but the rendered html result is:

Topic: OpenSuse

I've reported the issue on pagelist's issues too: https://github.com/dokufreaks/plugin-pagelist/issues/21, but on my opinion is more related with a blogtng, and here is why I think this:

I've first tried Rincewind just with tag and pagelist plugin, and it seems to work fine: adding tags, editing and reindexing. After I install blogtng then any editing on the pages or reindexing the tags, produces pagelist/tag not to work.

My objective is to have a "notes" namespace where each page can be tagged by i.e: {{tag>opensuse}}, and a "blog" namespace where I have some blog posts where each post is tagged by the blogtng fields editor, within Dokuwiki's editing UI.

rin-min Dokuwiki's contain just tag and pagelist plugins
rim-beta is a copy of rin-min including blogtng

Any suggestions?

Thanks a lot for your help and support!
