Albert, this is you speaking to yourself, please remember this...

====== Things to remember ======
  * **You are free!** Free from the little tiny and uncomfortable box that society want's to put you in.
  * **Try to do what you like, and like what you do.**
  * **Be curious, behold and keep thinking.**
  * **Be gentle and kind to people** try to help, and do **not expect nothing back**
  * **Think globally, act locally**. This is, one thing at the time, follow the GTD philosophy and avoid **analysis paralysis**.

====== Things to remember: As a believer ======
  * **God's will is above everything**. God has the power to turn things, like with Joseph that from being sold as a slave, he has been the second in charge in the whole Egypt (ref)
  * Learn to wait patiently, there is a time for everything in live (eclesiastes ref)
  * Be careful and wise with woman, (seol ref)
