PLEASE NOTE: I am NO native English speaker. If you find any errors please let
             me know (e.g. by mail). Otherwise, my English is not getting better
             (as desired by myself). Thank you! -- Andreas Haerter



I. Using/Installing the template
  Fist step:
  The basic install of "mnml-blog" is simple and works just as described at
  <http://www.dokuwiki.org/template>: extract the downloaded archive into
  your DokuWiki's "lib/tpl/" folder. Then select the template in the Config
  Manager by adjusting the template option. Done. :-)

  Second step:
  Check if the BlogTNG plugin is installed and up2date. This template is
  designed for the usage with the BlogTNG-Plugin *only* (it may work for other
  purposes, but I do not test or support anything else)! You can get the plugin
  at <http://dokuwiki.org/plugin:blogtng>.

  Third step:
  The files in "lib/tpl/mnml-blog/blogtng-tpl" are a BlogTNG data template
  (see <http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:blogtng#templates> for details). Please
  copy these files into all used BlogTNG data template dirs below
  "lib/plugins/blogtng/tpl".
  Hint: By default, there is only "lib/plugins/blogtng/tpl/default". You may
        overwrite the existing files in there (but remember: you have to do this
        again on every BlogTNG-Update then!).

  Fourth step:
  Create a wiki <blog list> page where all posting shall appear. Then look where
  the option "mnmlblog_newpostform_location" (-> "Use following wiki page for
  the '<blog newform>' form") points to (default is ":wiki:create_new_blogpost")
  and create a wiki <blog newform> page there (the "New Post" link at the bottom
  right of the footer is using this link). See
  <http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:blogtng> for details.



II. Customizing the template
  In order to make updates of your installed "mnml-blog" template easy, follow
  these hints for customizing the template:

  - Place your files in "mnml-blog/user"
    The place for *all* userdefined, custom stuff is "mnml-blog/user".
    Reason: this folder will not be touched on updates. Therefore you may delete
    everything except "mnml-blog/user" and copy all new files into "mnml-blog/"
    to update without loosing your changes. Do not forget to empty your
    browser's cache afterwards.

  - Own logo
    Ff you want to replace the default text showed in the headline, simply
    create a "logo.[png|gif|jpg]" in "mnml-blog/user". The template recognizes
    the file automatically and will use it instead of the default text.
    Do not forget to empty your browser's cache afterwards.

  - Own favicon
    If you want to replace the default favicon, simply create a "favicon.ico" in
    "mnml-blog/user". The template recognizes the file automatically and will
    use it instead of the default one. Do not forget to empty your browser's
    cache afterwards. By the way: you might find the following online tool
    useful: <http://tools.dynamicdrive.com/favicon/>
    Note: "favicon.png" is also possible but not recommended (cause it is not
          supported by most MSIE versions).

  - Own CSS
    To apply additional CSS rules, edit "mnml-blog/user/screen.css" (influences
    normal layout) and/or "mnml-blog/user/print.css" (influences print layout)
    and/or "mnml-blog/user/rtl.css" (influences "right-to-left" languages like
    hebrew). These files will be included automatically (as the last ones for
    the relevant media, therefore you are able to overrule existing styles). Do
    not forget to empty your browser's cache afterwards.

  - Own JavaScript
    To load additional JavaScript, edit "mnml-blog/user/user.js". Do not forget
    to empty your browser's cache afterwards.
    ATTENTION: Do not forget to activate the template option
               "mnml-blog_loaduserjs" (->"Load 'mnml-blog/user/user.js'?") in
               the DokuWiki Config Manager!

  - Own boxes
    To apply own boxes in the right column, have a look at
    "mnml-blog/user/boxes.php". Don't worry: you will find some examples how to
    define the boxes. If you still have questions after
    playing with the examples, search the DokuWiki Forum at
    <http://forum.dokuwiki.org> and/or ask the community if you can't get it
    work. If "mnml-blog/user/boxes.php" does not exist, simply copy it out of
    the current actual installation archive.

  - Web analytics software (Piwik, Google Analytics etc.)
    Tools like Piwik and Google Analytics normally provide a small code snippet
    ("tag") which you have to include at your website to make everything work.
    If you want to use such software with this template, have a look at
    "mnml-blog/user/tracker.php". This file exists to make it easier for you.
    You don't have to deliberate where you have to copy and paste the code,
    simply do it there.

  - Own Apple Touch Icon
    If you want to replace the default Apple Touch Icon, simply create a
    "apple-touch-icon.png" in "mnml-blog/user". The template recognizes the file
    automatically and will use it instead of the default one. Have a look at
    Apple's developer database if you need more information ("Configuring Web
    Applications" <http://j.mp/sx3NMT>).

IV. Other notes
  - Even if it is not required: If you like the template, think about a small
    donation (see <http://andreas-haerter.com/donate/dokuwiki-template-mnml-blog>)
    and/or a link to <http://andreas-haerter.com/projects/dokuwiki-template-mnml-blog>.
    Thanks :-).

  - This template follows the DokuWiki coding style (see
    <http://www.dokuwiki.org/devel:coding_style>). If you want to submit any
    patches, please respect its rules (even if you don't like it - I also don't
    love it but this simply does not matter).

  - Feel free to send patches or suggestions via mail (or post on
    <http://www.dokuwiki.org/template:mnml-blog>).

  - Please don't delete the "index.html" and ".htaccess" files for security
    reasons, even if you don't know why they are there. These files should
    prevent others from listing directory contents (a built in feature of most
    webservers) and providing additional access protection for some files. Even
    if everything should be secure without, I prefer some additional
    precautions.



V. About
  "mnml-blog" is a clean and minimalist template for DokuWiki. It is designed to
  use DokuWiki as blogging software. It was created by me (Andreas Haerter)
  mainly for my own blog at <http://blog.andreas-haerter.com>. The name means
  "minimalist blog". If you have any suggestions and/or bug reports, look out
  for report possibilities on <http://www.dokuwiki.org/template:mnml-blog>, feel
  free to send me an email or have a look at <http://andreas-haerter.com/contact>.



VI. Creation transcript
  Some developers may find this interesting. Additionally, I am very oblivious
  :-P.

  - In principle, I followed <http://j.mp/eq8zSo>. There was just no "starter"
    template when "mnml-blog" was created. Therefore, after ~1 year, I switched
    the CSS base from DokuWiki's default template to
    <http://www.dokuwiki.org/template:starter> but the markup of "main.php" is
    still based the "main.php" out of the "default" template.

  - Worked worked worked.... and done! :-P
