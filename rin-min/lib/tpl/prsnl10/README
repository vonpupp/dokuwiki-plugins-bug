PLEASE NOTE: I am NO native English speaker. If you find any errors please let
             me know (e.g. by mail). Otherwise, my English is not getting better
             (as desired by myself). Thank you! -- Andreas Haerter



I. Using/Installing the template
  Using "prsnl10" is simple and works just as described at
  <http://www.dokuwiki.org/template>: extract the downloaded archive into
  your DokuWiki's "lib/tpl/" folder. Then select the template in the Config
  Manager by adjusting the template option. Done. :-)



II. Customizing the template
  In order to make updates of your installed "prsnl10" template easy, follow
  these hints for customizing the template:

  - Place your files in "prsnl10/user"
    The place for *all* userdefined, custom stuff is "prsnl10/user".
    Reason: this folder will not be touched on updates. Therefore you may delete
    everything except "prsnl10/user" and copy all new files into "prsnl10/" to
    update without loosing your changes. Do not forget to empty your browser's
    cache afterwards.

  - Own logo
    If you want to replace the default text showed in the headline, simply
    create a "logo.[png|gif|jpg]" in "prsnl10/user". The template recognizes
    the file automatically and will use it instead of the default text.
    Do not forget to empty your browser's cache afterwards.
    HINT: If you want to use a text-based logo, you might find the font files
          for "Droid Sans" useful. You can download them at
          <http://www.google.com/webfonts/family?family=Droid+Sans>. Have a look
          at <http://j.mp/inYDGL> if you want to know more about.

  - Own favicon
    If you want to replace the default favicon, simply create a "favicon.ico" in
    "prsnl10/user". The template recognizes the file automatically and will use
    it instead of the default one. Do not forget to empty your browser's cache
    afterwards. By the way: you might find the following online tool useful:
    <http://tools.dynamicdrive.com/favicon/>
    Note: "favicon.png" is also possible but not recommended (cause it is not
          supported by most MSIE versions).

  - Own CSS
    To apply additional CSS rules, edit "prsnl10/user/screen.css" (influences
    normal layout) and/or "prsnl10/user/print.css" (influences print layout)
    and/or "prsnl10/user/rtl.css" (influences "right-to-left" languages like
    hebrew). These files will be included automatically (as the last ones for
    the relevant media, therefore you are able to overrule existing styles). Do
    not forget to empty your browser's cache afterwards.

  - Own JavaScript
    To load additional JavaScript, edit "prsnl10/user/user.js". Do not forget
    to empty your browser's cache afterwards.
    ATTENTION: Do not forget to activate the template option
               "prsnl10_loaduserjs" (->"Load 'prsnl10/user/user.js'?") in the
               DokuWiki Config Manager!

  - Web analytics software (Piwik, Google Analytics etc.)
    Tools like Piwik and Google Analytics normally provide a small code snippet
    ("tag") which you have to include at your website to make everything work.
    If you want to use such software with this template, have a look at
    "prsnl10/user/tracker.php". This file exists to make it easier for you.
    You don't have to deliberate where you have to copy and paste the code,
    simply do it there.

  - Own Apple Touch Icon
    If you want to replace the default Apple Touch Icon, simply create a
    "apple-touch-icon.png" in "prsnl10/user". The template recognizes the file
    automatically and will use it instead of the default one. Have a look at
    Apple's developer database if you need more information ("Configuring Web
    Applications" <http://j.mp/sx3NMT>).



III. Some notes about the dirs of this template
  * "prsnl10/conf"
    Contains configuration files:
    default.php:  default settings, see
                  <http://www.dokuwiki.org/devel:configuration#default_settings>
    metadata.php: configuration metadata, see
                  <http://www.dokuwiki.org/devel:configuration#configuration_metadata>
  * "prsnl10/lang"
    Language files (subdir names = language code). You may copy the English
    language files and translate them if your language is missing. Simply mail
    me (Andreas Haerter) the translated files and I will include them in the
    next release :-D.
  * "prsnl10/css"
    All Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). See <http://j.mp/eq8zSo> for more
    information about how the CSS is handled.
  * "prsnl10/images"
    Images files.
  * "prsnl10/js"
    JavaScript files.
  * "prsnl10/user"
    Place for userdefined stuff. E.g. if you want use an own logo, simply copy a
    logo.[png|gif|jpg] in here. See "II. Customizing the template" for details.



IV. Other notes
  - Even if it is not required: If you like the template, think about a small
    donation (see <http://andreas-haerter.com/donate/dokuwiki-template-prsnl10>)
    and/or a link to <http://andreas-haerter.com/projects/dokuwiki-template-prsnl10>.
    Thanks :-).

  - This template follows the DokuWiki coding style (see
    <http://www.dokuwiki.org/devel:coding_style>). If you want to submit any
    patches, please respect its rules (even if you don't like it - I also don't
    love it but this simply does not matter).

  - Feel free to send patches or suggestions via mail (or look out for report
    possibilities on <http://www.dokuwiki.org/template:prsnl10>).

  - Please don't delete the "index.html" and ".htaccess" files for security
    reasons, even if you don't know why they are there. These files should
    prevent others from listing directory contents (a built in feature of most
    webservers) and providing additional access protection for some files. Even
    if everything should be secure without, I prefer some additional
    precautions.



V. About
  "prsnl10" is a minimalist template for DokuWiki. It is designed to use
  DokuWiki as small CMS for portfolio websites and for other "non-wiki"
  purposes. It was created by me (Andreas Haerter), mainly for my own website at
  <http://andreas-haerter.com>. The name means "personal template, year 2010" 
  If you have any suggestions and/or bug reports, look out for report
  possibilities on <http://www.dokuwiki.org/template:prsnl10>, feel free to send
  me an email or have a look at <http://andreas-haerter.com/contact>.



VI. Creation transcript
  Some developers may find this interesting. Additionally, I am very oblivious
  :-P.

  - In principle, I followed <http://j.mp/eq8zSo>. There was just no "starter"
    template when "prsnl10" was created. Therefore, after ~1 year, I switched
    the CSS base from DokuWiki's default template to
    <http://www.dokuwiki.org/template:starter> but the markup of "main.php" is
    still based the "main.php" out of the "default" template.

  - Worked worked worked.... and done! :-P
